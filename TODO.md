## QA Audit Fixes ✅ COMPLETE (both rounds)

### Round 1 — 25 issues (all Critical + High fixed)

| # | Status | Issue |
|---|--------|-------|

### Round 2 — 13 issues (all fixed 2026-04-10)

| # | Status | Issue |
|---|--------|-------|
| R2-01 | [x] | `get_positions()` was hardcoded 0.0 — now reads real IBKR values via `ib.portfolio()` |
| R2-02 | [x] | `_handle_order_status()` double-lock race eliminated — single lock block |
| R2-03 | [x] | `_handle_cancel_order()` snapshots Trade inside lock |

| R2-05 | [x] | `sync()` calls `openTrades()` before acquiring lock |
| R2-06 | [x] | Unknown IBKR status logged as WARNING; `PendingCancel` added to enum |
| R2-07 | [x] | Error codes 502/503/504 classified as connection errors, forwarded to callbacks |
| R2-08 | [x] | `_clear_callbacks()` added; called in tests before each callback registration |
| R2-09 | [x] | `Position.fetched_at` timestamp added |
| R2-10 | [x] | Startup test cleanup reports count and waits appropriately |
| R2-11 | [x] | `connect()` retry loop uses `total_attempts` variable, logs "attempt N/M" |
| R2-12 | [x] | Tests use `logging.disable(INFO)` — WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL visible |
| R2-13 | [x] | `_best_price(ticker: Ticker)` type hint added |

---

## Sprint 2 — Stability & Risk ✅ COMPLETE

| # | Status | Priority | Task |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 2.1 | [x] | P0 | `ReconnectManager` — daemon thread, backoff [5,10,30,60,120]s, `sync()` after reconnect, strategies pause via `wait_for_connection()` |
| 2.2 | [x] | P0 | `RiskManager` — per-order cap, per-symbol exposure, daily loss ceiling, `plan_trade()` (validate + size atomically), `validate_setup()` supports longs and shorts |
| 2.3 | [x] | P1 | `PositionSizer` — `risk_based()` (primary, 2% rule), `fixed()`, `percent_of_equity()`, `kelly()` |
| 2.4 | [x] | P1 | Heartbeat — `is_alive()` via `reqCurrentTime()` |
| 2.5 | [x] | P1 | `validate_config()` + `ConfigError` — called first in `main()`, warns loudly on live port |
| 2.6 | [ ] | P2 | Virtual environment setup — `docs/setup.md` (deferred to Sprint 5.2) |
| 2.7 | [ ] | P2 | Alert system (email/Slack) — deferred to Sprint 6+ |

**New file layout for Sprint 2:**
```
risk/
  __init__.py
  risk_manager.py      # RiskManager, RiskViolationError
  position_sizer.py    # PositionSizer (static)
broker/
  reconnect.py         # ReconnectManager (NEW)
config/
  validator.py         # validate_config(), ConfigError (NEW)
docs/
  setup.md             # venv instructions (NEW)
```

**Updated `main.py` wiring order:**
1. `validate_config()`
2. `client = IBKRClient()`
3. `client.connect(retries=3)`
4. `om = OrderManager(client)`
5. `rm = RiskManager(client, ...)`
6. `reconnect = ReconnectManager(client, om)`
7. `reconnect.start()`
8. `om.on_fill(rm.record_fill)`
9. Load and start strategy

**Updated `BaseStrategy.__init__` signature:**
```python
def __init__(self, client, order_manager, risk_manager, reconnect)
```
Typical `on_tick()` guard at top:
```python
self.reconnect.wait_for_connection(timeout=30)
if self.risk_manager.is_halted(): return
```

## Sprint 3 — Data & Backtesting ✅ COMPLETE

| # | Status | Priority | Task |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 3.1 | [x] | P0 | `DataFeed` / `IBKRFeed` / `BarScheduler` — abstract feed, 5-sec real-time bars, timer-driven `on_tick()`, clean subscribe/unsubscribe |
| 3.2 | [x] | P0 | `HistoricalDataLoader` — `load_yfinance()`, `load_ibkr()` (11s rate limit), `load_csv()` |
| 3.3 | [x] | P0 | `BacktestEngine` + `MockOrderManager` + `BacktestDataFeed` — same strategy class runs live and in backtest, fills at next-bar open (no look-ahead bias) |
| 3.4 | [x] | P1 | `backtester/metrics.py` — `sharpe_ratio()`, `max_drawdown()`, `win_rate()`, `profit_factor()`, `summary()` |
| 3.5 | [x] | P1 | `TradeLog` (SQLite WAL) — `record()`, `get_history()`, `daily_summary()`, schema: cost_basis, realized_pnl, strategy_params |
| 3.6 | [x] | P2 | Paper simulation covered by BacktestEngine |

**New file layout for Sprint 3:**
```
data/
  __init__.py
  bar.py           # Bar dataclass
  feed.py          # DataFeed (abstract), IBKRFeed, BarScheduler
  historical.py    # HistoricalDataLoader
  trade_log.py     # TradeLog (SQLite)
backtester/
  __init__.py
  engine.py        # BacktestEngine, MockOrderManager
  portfolio.py     # BacktestPortfolio
  metrics.py       # pure metric functions
```

## Sprint 4 — Implement Strategy
### Goal: Pick a strategy → backtest it → run it on paper

| # | Status | Priority | Task |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 4.1 | [x] | P0 | Select first strategy — SMA 10/30 crossover on QQQ daily bars |
| 4.2 | [x] | P0 | Implement `strategies/sma_crossover.py` — 4 rounds of architect review. Round 4 verdict: GO. Post-GO hardening: Q2 (cancel any SELL on restart, not just STOP), Q3 (floor fallback stop at min(avg_cost, latest_close)*0.97), Q4/Q6a (on_tick re-arm broker STOP when _stop_order_id is None), log escalation (rejected-SELL → ERROR). |
| 4.3 | [x] | P0 | Backtest QQQ 2020-2024 (`backtests/backtest_sma_qqq.py`): +36% return, 2.27 profit factor, -12.7% max DD, 45% win rate. All fixes are live-only, backtest numbers unchanged. |
| 4.4 | [~] | P0 | Wire SMACrossover into main.py — DONE: RiskManager caps (120k/100k/-2k), daily scheduler at 16:10 ET, TradeLog wired via om.on_fill. Run on paper >= 1 week. |
| 4.5 | [ ] | P1 | Tune strategy parameters based on backtest + paper results |
| 4.6 | [ ] | P2 | Implement and backtest a second strategy |
| 4.7 | [ ] | P2 | Strategy parameter management (YAML/JSON config, no code changes to switch params) |
| 4.8 | [!] | P2 | Multi-strategy runner — blocked on Decision B (see below) |

---

## Sprint 5 — Wire Risk + Deploy to VPS
### Goal: Activate the daily loss ceiling, set up venv, deploy to Hostinger

| # | Status | Priority | Task |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 5.1 | [x] | P0 | `PnLPoller` daemon — wired and active in `main.py`. Calls `reset_daily()` at 9:30 AM ET, polls `update_daily_pnl()` every 60s, shuts down cleanly on exit |
| 5.2 | [x] | P0 | Set up Python virtual environment — handled by `deploy/setup.sh` on VPS |
| 5.3 | [x] | P0 | Hostinger VPS provisioned — Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, KVM 1, US Boston 2, IP 2.24.222.199 |
| 5.4 | [x] | P0 | IBC (headless IB Gateway) setup — `deploy/ibc/config.ini` + `deploy/ibc/start_ibgateway.sh` created. Run `deploy/setup.sh` on VPS to install. |
| 5.5 | [x] | P0 | `systemd` units created — `ibgateway.service`, `tradebot.service`, `tradebot-notify@.service`, `tradebot-health.service/.timer`. All in `deploy/systemd/`. |
| 5.6 | [x] | P1 | Health heartbeat — `on_tick()` writes UTC timestamp to `data/health.txt`; `tradebot-health.timer` checks every 2h, notifies via ntfy.sh if stale >26h |
| 5.7 | [~] | P2 | Monitoring dashboard — **Phase 1** (read-only telemetry) done 2026-05-02: `/api/health`, `/api/today`, `/api/recent-fills`, `/api/info` + polling HTML UI. **Phase 2** done 2026-05-02 (`d3e286d`, PRs #30/#31): `/api/system` adds bot PID/uptime + IB Gateway service status + port 4001 check; UI gained System card. **Stale-threshold fix** (`b6515f4`, PRs #32/#33): `_stale_threshold_seconds()` returns 80h on weekend / Monday-pre-tick, 26h trading days — Liveness no longer false-alarms over weekends. `tradebot-dashboard.service` binds 0.0.0.0:8080 reachable via Tailscale. **Pending VPS deploy** (`git pull + systemctl restart tradebot-dashboard`) and **Phase 3** (control plane: kill/restart with token auth). |
| 5.8 | [x] | P2 | CI/CD pipeline (auto-run tests on push to GitHub) — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `Makefile` added 2026-05-01 |
| 5.9 | [x] | P1 | IBKR Trusted IP whitelist — **CLOSED: won't do.** Account-level IP Restrictions allows only one IP per user; adding VPS would block home PC access. Takes a business day to change. Gateway API Trusted IPs (different feature) already set to 127.0.0.1 in IBC config — no action needed. |
| 5.10 | [x] | P0 | VPS deployment debugged — IBC empty password fixed, Read-Only API unchecked + `ReadOnlyApi=no` in config, 2FA loop resolved via `ExistingSessionDetectedAction=manual`, `UseSSL=yes` added |
| 5.11 | [x] | P0 | Risk caps updated for QQQ paper account — max_order=$120k, max_position=$100k, max_daily_loss=-$2,000. Merged via PR. |
| 5.12 | [x] | P0 | VPS hardened — Tailscale installed, UFW blocks port 22, SSH only via `ssh chappy-vps` (Tailscale IP). `chappy` user replaces root. CLAUDE.md updated. |
| 5.13 | [x] | P1 | Hybrid Git Flow implemented — main/develop/feature/hotfix branches, PR-only policy, Claude enforcement rules added to CLAUDE.md. `develop` branch created and synced. |
| 5.14 | [x] | P0 | **IB Gateway under systemd** (2026-04-30). Created `xvfb.service`, `x11vnc.service`, `ibgateway.service` — all enabled, chained via `Requires=`/`After=`. Replaces the old backgrounded/disowned IBC process. Recovered bot from 6-day outage caused by Sunday Apr 26 token reset with no human to enter 2FA. |
| 5.15 | [x] | P1 | **IBC config: 2FA timeout recovery** (2026-04-30). Added `ReloginAfterSecondFactorAuthenticationTimeout=yes` to `/opt/ibc/config.ini` so IBC re-prompts instead of sitting silently after a 2FA timeout. |
| 5.16 | [ ] | P1 | **IBKR support inquiry — push 2FA for Israeli account.** Owner is on Interactive IL Key (code generator). Ask: (a) can we switch to push-notification IB Key? (b) any unattended weekly auth path for paper? Draft email is in CLAUDE.md / Obsidian handoff. |

**VPS readiness checklist (must all be done before going live):**

| Requirement | Status | Sprint |
|---|---|---|
| Config validation (no accidental live port) | ✅ Done | 2.5 |
| RiskManager with daily loss ceiling | ✅ Active — PnLPoller wired in main.py | 2.2 / 5.1 |
| Auto-reconnect + strategy pause during gap | ✅ Done | 2.1 |
| SIGTERM handler for clean systemd shutdown | ✅ Done | Sprint 4 pre-flight |
| Virtual environment | ✅ Done — handled by deploy/setup.sh on VPS | 5.2 |
| IBC (headless IB Gateway on VPS) | ✅ Running under systemd (`ibgateway.service`) since 2026-04-30 | 5.4 / 5.14 |
| systemd process supervisor | ✅ Full chain: xvfb → x11vnc → ibgateway → tradebot. All enabled, all auto-start on boot. | 5.5 / 5.14 |
| Strategy backtested and validated | ✅ Done — QQQ SMA backtest 4.3 | 4.3 |
| Strategy paper-traded and monitored | [~] In progress — bot live on VPS paper account | 4.4 |

## Sprint 6 — Paper Trading Period
### Goal: Run paper for 2–4 weeks, monitor fills and P&L, fix issues before going live

| # | Status | Priority | Task |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 6.1 | [ ] | P0 | Monitor `TradeLog.daily_summary()` every trading day — check realized_pnl, trade count, fill quality |
| 6.2 | [ ] | P0 | Verify fills are happening at expected prices (compare backtest vs paper fills) |
| 6.3 | [ ] | P0 | Verify daily loss ceiling triggers correctly if a simulated loss is fed via `update_daily_pnl()` |
| 6.4 | [ ] | P0 | Check reconnect behaviour — confirm bot recovers cleanly after TWS daily restart (~11:45 PM EST). **Note:** Mon–Sat restarts use cached token (no 2FA). Sunday ~01:00 ET requires owner to enter fresh 2FA via VNC — see CLAUDE.md "Weekly 2FA cadence" section. First test: Sunday 2026-05-03. |
| 6.5 | [~] | P1 | Review logs weekly — look for WARNING/ERROR patterns (6.C done: IBKR info codes 1100/1102/2103/2105/2107/2157 demoted from ERROR to INFO/WARNING in order_manager.py — PR #9 merged to develop) |
| 6.6 | [ ] | P1 | Adjust `max_order_value`, `max_position_value`, `max_daily_loss` limits based on paper results |
| 6.7 | [ ] | P2 | Research best MCP servers / APIs for live and historical market data (Polygon.io, Alpaca, FMP) |
| 6.8 | [ ] | P2 | Build `RESOURCES.md` with vetted sources for strategies, risk management, market microstructure |

**Go/No-Go criteria before Sprint 7 (live trading):**
- [ ] Strategy profitable or near-breakeven over 2–4 weeks on paper
- [ ] No unexpected crashes or missed fills
- [ ] Daily loss ceiling confirmed working
- [ ] Bot auto-recovers from TWS daily restart without manual intervention
- [ ] Risk limits reviewed and set conservatively for live

---

## Sprint 7 — Go Live (Small Position Sizes)
### Goal: Switch to live account with minimal risk to verify everything works with real money

| # | Status | Priority | Task |
|---|--------|----------|------|
| 7.1 | [ ] | P0 | Decision A: subscribe to IBKR live market data (~$10–25/month)? Required for intraday; optional for daily-bar strategies |
| 7.2 | [ ] | P0 | Change `.env` `IB_PORT=7496` (live) — config validator will warn loudly |
| 7.3 | [ ] | P0 | Set position size to minimum (1–5 shares per trade) for first 2 weeks live |
| 7.4 | [ ] | P0 | Set `max_daily_loss` very conservatively (e.g., -$50) for first live run |
| 7.5 | [ ] | P0 | Monitor live fills for first week daily — compare to paper performance |
| 7.6 | [ ] | P1 | Gradually increase position size as confidence grows |
| 7.7 | [ ] | P1 | Decision B: multi-strategy positions — independent or combined caps? |
| 7.8 | [ ] | P2 | Email/Slack alerts on fill, daily loss breach, and error codes |

---

## Owner Decisions Required

These two questions are not blocking Sprint 2 or 3, but must be answered before Sprint 4.

| # | Decision | Options | Deadline |
|---|----------|---------|----------|
| A | Live market data subscription (~$10–25/month via IBKR)? | **Yes** = real-time signals, works for intraday. **No** = 15-min delayed, fine for end-of-day strategies, free. | Before Sprint 4 |
| B | Multi-strategy position behavior: when two strategies both want to buy the same stock, do they act independently (each gets own position) or combine into one? | **Independent (default)** = Strategy A buys 10, Strategy B buys 10 → 20 shares total. **Combined** = shared cap, more complex. | Before Sprint 4.5 |

## Bugs & Improvements Log

| # | Severity | Description | Status |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|
| B-01 | S1 | `limit_price=0` and negative `limit_price` not rejected | Fixed |
| B-02 | S1 | `OrderManager.__init__` crashed when not connected | Fixed |
| B-03 | S2 | `cancel_order()` returned `True` for already-cancelled orders | Fixed |
